# 🐍 Python Playground

Welcome to my **Python Playground** — a personal repository where I practice and explore Python programming through tutorials, puzzles, and mini projects.  
This repository is continuously evolving as I learn and experiment with new ideas.

---

## 📚 Contents

This repo currently contains:

- **Python Tutorials** — practice scripts from my learning journey  
- **Practice Puzzles** — logic problems, riddles, and challenges solved in Python  
- **Mini Projects** — small games and utilities such as:
  - Number Guessing Game
  - Word Guessing Game
  - (More coming soon!)

## 🍾 Current Projects

### **Word Guessing Game**
A Python-based game where players guess scrambled engineering-related words.  
- Choose a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard  
- Earn points based on difficulty and number of attempts  
- Avoids repeated words for more challenge  
- Engineering-themed word bank

💡 Fun Fact: This game was built as part of a practice session to combine coding with gamification.

### **Number Guessing Game**
A simple game where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a limited number of tries.  
Includes feedback hints to improve guessing strategies.

## 🚀 How to Run a Project

Each project has its own `.py` file.  
Run them individually in your Python environment:

```bash
python project_name.py
```

Example:

```bash
python word_guessing_game.py
```
